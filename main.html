                <h2>2019 - The Idea</h2>
                <p>So pretty much I wanted to find out how many common words does the English song FAITH by MADKID have.
                  So as a result, I implemented a word counter for songs in Java through the use of a Hashmap. That way
                  I can finally know how certain words come up.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="container right">
              <div class="right">
                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <p>Hashmaps make it easy to know where to locate values 
                  based on keys and it allows for easy insertion/deletion, despite the lack of order. Figured, I don't need any need of sorting, just word frequency. So HashMaps make it one less problem for me. It also helps when a data is identified with a key pair, which in my case is just the frequency. Cool right?!</p>
                <p>In the future I might add a GUI interface and make it look good for the average person. I could implement APIs that would call automatic extraction of lyrics based on a user's input of a song and they can search for it in a database. As for the website, add Frameworks and more Javascript to make it even more impressive!</p>

                <h2>The Song</h2>
                <p>FAITH is pretty much the second theme song to the second opening of The Rising of the Shield Hero anime I watched a while back. So I figured why not? It was really catchy and a good and inspirational beat with their other song RISE. The song was a hit in Japan and the anime is a hit from a few months back.  Some words like "faith", "never", and "silent" really weren't that suprising (I do listen to this song 100 times a day after all). But it was crazy to see the words, "millions", "hundreds", and "change"pop up the most. These guys really love numbers. But it does make sense about a song about sheer determination. One of their chorus has this verse, "In the distorted world, following the footsteps, suppress the silent shout, hundreds of times, even,millions of times, I find & Create myself, now or never." See? These guys don't give up.</p>
